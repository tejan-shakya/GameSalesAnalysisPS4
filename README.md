# GameSalesAnalysisPS4
This project explores the global video game sales market up until 2024, analyzing performance trends across multiple regions, platforms, and genres. The dataset captures key metrics such as sales volumes, platforms, genres, and regional distribution, providing insights into consumers' preferences. While the dataset covers the broader gaming industry, the primary focus is on sales performance for PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One (XOne) consoles.

## Data Source
- ```Video Game Sales 24.csv```
- [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/video-game-sales-2024)

## Goals
- What are the top 10 Video Game Sales based on critic score?
- What are the top-selling game genres for PS4 and XOne globally?
- Which region contributes the most to global sales?
- Which year saw the highest and lowest sales volumes?

## Note
The dataset for the XOne is considerably smaller compared to that of the PS4, which may introduce bias into the analysis. Given the limited representation of XOne titles and the insufficent data to support a robust comparative study, the subsequent analysis after popular genre in this project will focus exclusively on PS4 games.
